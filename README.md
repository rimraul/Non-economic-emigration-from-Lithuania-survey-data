The project data management plan foresees 2 years embargo period for the datasets after the completion of the project therefore a 10% simple ramdom sample is made available (both for the main survey and for the secondary survey). 

The main survey data were collected in the Autumn of 2019 by UAB Eurotela. The secondary survey was initiated in December 2021 to investigate possible impact of Covid-19 pandemics on emigration intentions of Lithuanians with a shorther version of questionnaire and some new questions.
